title: "Higher Order Reasoning"
---

The goal of this presentation is to introduce functions in the functional programming
sense. We will think about why these are different from methods in Java. Once
we start to get an understanding of these differences, we will explore how much
information we can get out of the type signature of functions. Finally, we will
talk about what it means to be a first class function, and how this allows
functions to be cleaner and more reusable.

I gave this talk at a
[University of Arizona ACM](http://uofa-acm.github.io/2014/10/09/Higher-Order-Reasoning/)
weekly meeting on October 9th, 2014 as a simple introduction to pure functional
programming and reasoning for people with very little experience in FP or
programming in general.
