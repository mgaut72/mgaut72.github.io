title: "Service Oriented Architecture"
---

Service oriented architecture (SOA) is the organization of a system into disjoint
sections of code that communicate over some networking protocol.

For my software engineering course, we built a cryptocurrency dashboard.
Our system has a service oriented architecture, with the web API communicating
with services that manage cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges.

At the time of this talk, I thought SOA was the hip new thing that all the cool
kids (such as twitter) were using. Turns out SOA has been around a while, but
I think thats because its generally a pretty good idea.

Without further ado, the talk:
